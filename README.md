# tsfetch
It's like Neofetch, but written in Typescript

tsfetch is a work in progress, not all distros are available yet! If you don't see your distro here, feel free to make a PR.

tsfetch is an alternative to the popular Neofetch, made to be more reliable and stable compared to Neofetch. Since Neofetch is written entirely in bash, its speed is extremely slow, and the code is extremely bloated (over 1k lines before actual code gets ran type bloated).
